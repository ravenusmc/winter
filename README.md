# Winter Background

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.22-1.
This project is a simple Angular project which I am mainly building to continue working with Angular but also to have more practice for the upcoming National Skills USA contest. 

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
